           <h2> What Is Career Guidance? </h2>
           <p>The word “guidance” originated back in the 1530s, and is defined as the process of directing conduct. Career guidance can be defined as a comprehensive, developmental program designed to assist individuals in making and implementing informed educational and occupational choices. In simple words, it is a journey on which people develop to make mature and informed decisions. It is the act of guiding or showing the way; it is the act of seeking advice.</p>
